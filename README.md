# Functionality-Focused Code Organziation

The magic of jQuery's CSS-based selection makes it easy to think about our code in terms of the DOM, and sometimes that approach is exactly right. Other times, though, what we're trying to accomplish is only tangentially related to our nodes, and opting for an approach where we think in terms of functionality -- not how that functionality is manifested on our page -- can pay big dividends in terms of flexibility. In this talk, we'll look at a small sample application where the DOM takes a back seat to functionality-focused modules, and see how the approach can change the way we write and organize our code.

This is a repository for my presentation at the 2010 jQuery Conference in Boston, MA.
